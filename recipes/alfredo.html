        <h2>This is how it looks like.</h2>
        <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
        <p>This Alfredo sauce should be thick enough as-is. However, if you’d like to thicken it up even more, add more Parmesan than the recipe calls for. Continue whisking in cheese until the sauce has reached the desired consistency.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <h3>Recipe:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter, then stir in the cream and simmer.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the cheese and garlic until heated through and smooth.</li>
            <li>Stir in the parsley.</li>
            <li>I have found that Parmesan cheese doesn't always melt well, and often substitute Gruyère cheese.</li>
